    <h1><div class="content">Here are some precautions you can take to protect yourself and your property from coastal flooding:</div></h1></div>

    <h2> What To Do During a Flood?</h2>
    1. Elevate your home from the base while constructing to avoid entry of floodwater or construct walls to stop it.<br>
    2. Install "check valves" in sewer pipes to prevent floodwater from entering the drains of your home.<br>
    3. If your home is in very low land, then shift to a safer place and keep all furniture at an elevated level.<br>
    4. Keep all your documents in a safe water-proof bag.<br>
    5. Keep updated with flood safety tips given by the Government.<br>
    6. Know the safest route of escape to the nearest shelter.<br>
    7. Install the electricity supplying switches and plugs above a certain level from the floor, which is most unlikely to get reached by the floodwater.<br>
    8. Keep all your electronic devices in secure water proof bags.<br>
    
    <h2> What Not to Do During a Flood?</h2>
    1. Do not go in the flood-prone zone or leave your home if there is any flood forecast.<br>
    2. Take all valuables with you and do not keep any valuables at home as you have to evacuate the place.<br>
    3. Do not ignore advice, messages, or instructions given by Government and local municipal bodies.<br>
    4. Do not litter plastics, garbage, or any blockage making materials in the drains.<br>
    
    <h2> Safety Precautions to Follow if Flood Is Likely to Hit Your Area</h2>
    1. Keep calm and updated with news broadcast channels.<br>
    2. Be aware of the flash flood.<br>
    3. Take all flood safety measures.<br>
    4. Do not enter flood-prone areas as precautions during floods.<br>
    5. Keep the drainage system of your house clean and out of any blockage.<br>
    6. Unplug electrical gadgets and machinery and keep away from the reach of water.<br>
    7. Store enough food and drinking water with you.<br>
    8. Turn off gas valves and connected devices.<br>
