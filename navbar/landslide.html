        <h2> Here are some precautions to take before, during, and after a landslide:</h2>

       <h3 style="color: blue;"> Before a Landslide</h3>
        - Assess the soil before constructing your home or taking any property in a landslide-prone or hilly area.<br>
        - Make buildings away from the steep slopes, edge of mountains, drainage ways, or natural erosion valleys.<br>
        - Build embankments on the gradient slopes.<br>
        - Build retaining walls.<br>
        - Fit flexible gas pipes to avoid leakage.<br>
        - Buy insurance that covers the damage caused to your property for landslide damage.<br>
        - Implement land-use zoning cover in areas most vulnerable to landslides or other natural hazards.<br>
        - Prepare evacuation plans and an emergency supply kit containing all necessary items required during such hazards.<br>
        - Stay updated with the latest emergency information through radio alerts and television sources.<br>
        
        *<h3 style="color: blue;">During a Landslide</h3>
        - Evacuate the landslide susceptible place as early as possible.<br>
        - Carry necessary documents with you. Carry emergency medicine kit, dry food, and drinking water.<br>
        - Use alternate routes which have less landslide susceptibility to reach an evacuation shelter location.<br>
        - Use a battery-powered radio to follow the latest updates.<br>
        
        <h3 style="color: blue;">After a Landslide</h3>
        - Clear gutters and downspouts to prevent water accumulation.<br>
        - Reinforce slopes with retaining walls or barriers, and ensure proper drainage to redirect water away from vulnerable areas.<br><br>
        
        <strong> Remember, landslides are natural disasters that can cause significant damage. It's important to stay informed and prepared to protect yourself and your property.</strong><br>
