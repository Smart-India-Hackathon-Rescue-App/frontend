    <h2>When You Are Indoors:</h2>
    
    1. Immediately drop to the ground.<br>
    2. Reach a safe place such as under a table.<br>
    3. If you don't find any table near you, crouch at a corner of the building and cover your face and head with your arms.<br>
    4. Stay under any sturdy furniture, corner or inner door of your building.<br>
    5. Move away from any glass furniture/windows which could fall on you.<br>
    6. Shield your head with a pillow to avoid injuries against falling debris and glass.<br>
      
    <h2 >When You Are Outside</h2>
    1. If you are outside, remain at the place where you are till the tremor stops.<br>
    2. Move aside from trees, buildings or electrical connections.<br>
    3. Stay away from any loose utility wires or fuel/gas lines.<br>
    4. If you are travelling in a car during an earthquake, stop immediately and remain in your vehicle. Proceed only when the earthquake stops.
    <br>
    <h2>If You Are Trapped Under Debris</h2>
    1. If you are trapped under debris, make sure not to light a match to avoid fire risks.<br>
    2. Stay calm and do not move.<br>
    3. Tap on a metal or whistle if available to help rescuers locate you.<br>
    4. Shout only as a last resort. If you shout, you may inhale a large amount of dust which can be dangerous.<br>
    
   <h2> After the Earthquake:</h2>
    1. Administer First Aid: Attend to individuals with minor injuries using first aid kits.<br>
    2. CPR and Rescue Breathing: If someone is not breathing, administer rescue breathing. If the person has no pulse, perform CPR.<br>
    3. Be Mindful of Hazards: Attend any hazards that might have been caused by the earthquake.<br>
